API
=====================================================
1) API stands for Application Programming Interface

2) Application is a machine that does the work for us-it gives us the
functionality and we are not interested in what it does inside in
order to produce the desired effect-the functionality

3) Interface is how a machine takes input and gives output

-APIs let you write applications that use other applications

-So you can write an application that talks to twitter, facebook or github

-Websites solve problems and APIs of websites let developers use those
problem solving capabilities in their own apps

-Developers can use existing APIs/an existing product in imaginative ways

-Entire businesses can be built around an API
